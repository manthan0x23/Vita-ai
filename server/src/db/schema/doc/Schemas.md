## Relationships

### One-to-Many Relationships
- `users` â†’ `task_history` (One user has many task actions)
- `users` â†’ `user_goals` (One user has many goals)
- `users` â†’ `user_metrics` (One user has many metric records)
- `users` â†’ `user_tasks` (One user has many task assignments)
- `tasks` â†’ `task_history` (One task has many user actions)
- `tasks` â†’ `user_tasks` (One task can be assigned to many users)

### One-to-One Relationships
- `users` â†’ `user_super_goals` (One user has one set of super goals)

## Key Features

### Task Management
- **Time-gated Tasks**: Tasks can be scheduled for specific times of day
- **Impact Weighting**: Tasks have configurable importance levels
- **Effort Estimation**: Minimum time requirements help users plan
- **Alternative Tasks**: Fallback options for main tasks
- **Micro Tasks**: Smaller versions of tasks for easier completion

### Progress Tracking
- **Action History**: Complete audit trail of all user interactions
- **Ignore Tracking**: Monitors how often users skip tasks
- **Completion Tracking**: Records when and how often tasks are completed
- **Daily Metrics**: Captures actual measurements vs. goals

### Goal System
- **Flexible Goals**: Individual goals per wellness category
- **Default Settings**: System-wide defaults in super goals
- **Multiple Units**: Support for various measurement types
- **Category-based**: Organized by wellness domains

## Default Values

The system includes sensible defaults for new users:
- **Hydration**: 2400ml daily
- **Movement**: 8000 steps daily  
- **Sleep**: 8 hours daily
- **Screen Time**: 120 minutes daily limit
- **Mood**: 0 (baseline)

## Usage Patterns

### Daily Workflow
1. System presents time-gated tasks based on current time
2. Users interact with tasks (complete, dismiss, or ignore)
3. All actions are logged in task history
4. Daily metrics are recorded for progress tracking
5. System adjusts task recommendations based on user patterns

### Analytics & Insights
- Track completion rates by task and category
- Monitor ignore patterns to identify problematic tasks
- Analyze progress toward goals over time
- Identify peak performance times and patterns

## Database Considerations

### Performance
- Indexed foreign keys for efficient joins
- Composite unique constraints for data integrity
- Serial primary keys for optimal insertion performance

### Data Integrity
- Foreign key constraints maintain referential integrity
- Enum types ensure valid status values
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate goals per user

### Scalability
- Separate tables for different data access patterns
- History table for audit requirements
- Metrics table designed for time-series data
